The first Pokemon game I ever played was Pokemon Gold. I still remember the day my parents took me to the store and told me
they were finally in agreement on purchasing me a Gameboy Color. I could hardly contain my excitment. I went straight to 
the eletronic section, picked up a neon green color Game Boy Color, and the most popular game at the time, Pokemon Gold (Silver).

That was 19 years ago...

Today, I purchased my second ever Pokemon game, Pokemon Sword (Sheild) for the Nintendo Switch.
