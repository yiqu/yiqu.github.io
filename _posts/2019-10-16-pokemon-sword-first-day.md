The first Pokemon game I ever played was Pokemon Gold. I still remember the day my parents took me to the store and told me
they were finally in agreement on purchasing me a Gameboy Color. I could hardly contain my excitment. I went straight to 
the eletronic section, picked up a neon green color Game Boy Color, and the most popular game at the time, Pokemon Gold (Silver).

And that was 19 years ago...

Today, I purchased my second ever Pokemon game, Pokemon Sword (Sheild) for the Nintendo Switch. Sword and Shield takes place in Galar region, it is a brand new region Pokemon has released just for this game. Galar is modeled after the U.K. You will see a lot of resemblance of the green country side of England, and mountains of Scotland in the game. The old rustic
towns with brick fronts are a lot like the old towns of England. There is even a bridge in game I saw that looks very 
simlar to the London Bridge.

As you start your journey in Galar, the first thing you do is pick a stater Pokemon. This is the same as all other
Pokemon games. The three starters are:

They all have their own unique attributes, so choose wisely.

The game starts with you, the player, watching a Pokemon Trainer named Leon battle on T.V. Leon has never lost, 
and you are very good friends with his little brother, Hop. You and Hop goes to greet Leon, and Leon brings the three
starter Pokemons and tells you guys to pick one. 

I can already predict that at some point of the game, you will battle Leon for the spot of Pokemon Champion. Hop is a 
trainer you will be battling throughout the game. After 30 mins of playing, I had already battle him twice.
