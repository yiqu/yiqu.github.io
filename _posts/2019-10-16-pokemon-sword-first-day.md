The first Pokemon game I ever played was Pokemon Gold. I still remember the day my parents took me to the store and told me
they were finally in agreement on purchasing me a Gameboy Color. I could hardly contain my excitment. I went straight to 
the eletronic section, picked up a neon green color Game Boy Color, and the most popular game at the time, Pokemon Gold (Silver).

And that was 19 years ago...

Today, I purchased my second ever Pokemon game, Pokemon Sword (Sheild) for the Nintendo Switch. Sword and Shield takes place in Galar region, it is a brand new region Pokemon has released just for this game. Galar is modeled after the U.K. You will see a lot of resemblance of the green country side of England, and mountains of Scotland in the game. The old rustic
towns with brick fronts are a lot like the old towns of England. There is even a bridge in game I saw that looks very 
simlar to the London Bridge.

#### Starters

As you start your journey in Galar, the first thing you do is pick a stater Pokemon. This is the same as all other
Pokemon games. The three starters are:

They all have their own unique attributes, so choose wisely.

The game starts with you, the player, watching a Pokemon Trainer named Leon battle on T.V. Leon has never lost, 
and you are very good friends with his little brother, Hop. You and Hop goes to greet Leon, and Leon brings the three
starter Pokemons and tells you guys to pick one. 

I can already predict that at some point of the game, you will battle Leon for the spot of Pokemon Champion. Hop is a 
trainer you will be battling throughout the game. After 30 mins of playing, I had already battle him twice.

#### Graphics

Sword and Shield probably has the best graphics so far in all of the Pokemon games series. The camera view is very fluid.
You can change the camera angle with the right joystick, while moving with the left. Camera can be zoomed out as well. But 
there is only one level of zoom out allowed.

The towns and wild areas are just amazing in terms of looks and feel. The game has very vibrant colors, which brings a 
lot nostlagia of the Pokemon T.V. show.

#### Gameplay

Sword and Shield is very similar to the other games in term of gameplay. You will have to grind the levels just like
before. There are items, berries, TMs, speical items, items to hold, etc. One new addition I really like in this game
is the "Shared Experience" feature. Everytime you gain exp. your entire Pokemon squad gains experience. The Pokemon
that was used gains the full experience, and the rest gains a percentage of the experience. This means
you don't have to use a Pokemon for him/her to gain experience. This is nice for making sure everybody is close in 
levels, and does not fall behind.

The Pokemon Center is the same. There are "Boxes" to put your extra Pokemons, you can access these in the Pokecenter.

![alt text][box]

A box storing Pokemons. They can be swapped out to your main squad.


The fighting aspect is pretty much the same. Obviously the graphics has improved, and it is more realstic.
