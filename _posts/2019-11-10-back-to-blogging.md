### New Theme
If you are like me, someone who puts heavy emphasis on how something looks, then I hope you
enjoy the new theme that I am using for my blog. It is a theme forked off [Hyde](https://github.com/poole/hyde) by
Mark Otto.

The theme is pretty simple and minimalist. Let me know how you feel about it.
