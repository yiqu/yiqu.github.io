Javascript is usually considered a wild wild west language. There are countless memes made about how Javascript is the weird and quirky 
language that no one wants to touch. You can see many blog posts about it [here](https://blog.mgechev.com/2013/02/22/javascript-the-weird-parts/) and [here](https://charlieharvey.org.uk/page/javascript_the_weird_parts).

In this post, I would like to explore some of the common gotchas of the Javascript language.

#### Math.min() > Math.max()

<code>Math.min()</code> is greater than <code>Math.max()</code>. This sounds weird, right? If no arguments are given, <code>Math.min()</code> returns <code>infinity</code> and <code>Math.max()</code> returns <code>-infinity</code>. Why does Math.min() return Infinity?
Well <code>Math.min(arg1, arg2,..)</code> will return the smallest number in the list. 

If there is only one argument provided, then it will return that number. So if the default argument is <code>-Inifinity</code>, then for every number provided in the argument list, it will *always* return <code>-Infinity</code>, which renders the function useless. Therefore <code>Inifinity</code> is the default value, and thus if any one single argument is provided, then that number would be the result returned.

```javascript
Math.min(1) 
// 1
Math.min(1, infinity)
// 1
Math.min(1, -infinity)
// -infinity
```
