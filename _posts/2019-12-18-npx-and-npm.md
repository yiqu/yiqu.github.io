If you are learning how to use a new Javascript framework or library, you might see a following command <code>npx name-of-package ...</code>
in the Getting Started section. You might say to yourself, wow they made a typo! Actually they did not. <code>npx</code> and <code>npm</code>
are very different things, and it was meant to be used that way.

#### npm

We all know what <code>npm</code> does, it is a package manager that manages and installs the application's modules based on the application's
<code>package.json</code> file.
