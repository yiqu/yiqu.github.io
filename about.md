### About Me
###### Software developer by day, tinkerer by night.    
<br/>

I am a UI developer specializing in Angular and React.

I have project management experiences overseeing the full software development life cycle. I have designed, and implemented solutions under both monolith and microservices architectural patterns. My proficiencies include software design, web service administration, code base administration, requirements analysis, automated testing, and database management.

I also have experiences mentoring junior team members to ensure all software development processes are upheld and to serve as a technical leader. I am quick to develop a sense of ownership for any project he takes on and reacts positively constructive criticism.

In my free time, I like to create self-development projects in order to experiment with new and emerging frameworks in the industry. Check out my  projects [here](https://yiqu.github.io/category/projects.html).
